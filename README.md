# Hide and Seek (and Tag)

A top-down chase game against a team of drones that work together to hunt you down. Both the player and the hunters have limited line-of-sight vision, and leave behind visible footprints (which the hunters can use to track you!). You can choose whether to go up against one, two, or three hunters.

Created solo over three weeks for a class final project.

Features three modes with different high score conditions:

- Countdown: Survive and collect coins until the time limit
- Survival: Survive as long as possible
- Collection: Collect the coins as quickly as possible

How to Play:

- WASD or Arrow keys to move
- Hold LSHIFT or Left Click to sprint
